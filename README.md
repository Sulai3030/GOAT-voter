 * Introduction
    The purpose of the GOAT Voter APP is to provide a one-stop platform where individuals
    can search and access information about candidates that are running for political offices anywhere in the United States.

*   The GOAT Voter App is a useful tool that streamlines information and helps to increase voter participation.

*   The App will allow users to create a user name and pass word to store their search history

*   How the GOAT Voter App works:
    By entering their zip code in a search button, users will be able to search and access detailed information about all candidates that are running for elections in their disctrict. 
    In addition, users can enter their exact address to:
     . find out where their polling site is located, 
     . request for free transportation on election day.
